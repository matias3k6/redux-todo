# Redux test to know how it works

This is a personal project to learn how redux logic works, how to create actions or functions that create actions, how to program a reducer to process information and create new states to make them available in the state tree.
I connect the components with connect() to access the state tree and dispatch actions.

### Next steps
 * Replace connect() with hooks to connect components
 * Persist store state before reload
